# Compact Mac Repair Notes

Disclaimer

I have no affiliation with Apple Inc and don't claim to own any of their intellectual property. These notes are purely taken from mine and others observation of some examples of compact Macintosh computers while trying to restore them to working order.

In all cases where I have used other repair resources to source information I have either sought and obtained permission to reproduce them here, or link to them, or if the resource is non-responsive and appears likely to disappear from the web I will respond swiftly to remove any information if asked to do so.
